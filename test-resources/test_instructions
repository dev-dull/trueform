Run the tests found in the `test-resoruces/` directory in the order of create, modify, import. Credentials to a VM of TrueNAS can be found in `test-resources/creds`. After testing, be sure to revert credentials back to the placeholder values. Fix any issues you find with the provider or update the the Terraform code in `test-resources/` as needed. If you update the provider and it tests as working, then cut a new release, taking care not to push any any credentials to git. Prompt me to revert to a snapshot of the TrueNAS VM if needed.
